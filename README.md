# Chess Game - Kotlin Multiplatform

This repository contains a chess game built with **Kotlin Multiplatform**, primarily for **Android**. The project follows best practices like **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **functional programming**, and **test-driven development (TDD)**.

The game logic includes chess rules, movement validation, castling, and pawn promotion. The UI is developed using **Jetpack Compose**, ensuring a modern and flexible experience.

## Features
- Chess logic with movement validation  
- Special moves like **castling** and **pawn promotion**  
- **Jetpack Compose** UI  
- **Kotlin DSL** for board configuration  
- **Test-driven development (TDD)**  

## What I Learned
During the development of this project, I improved my skills in:
- **Kotlin Multiplatform** for cross-platform development  
- **Design patterns** like Factory and Builder  
- **Jetpack Compose** for declarative UI  
- **Test-driven development (TDD)** for reliable logic  
- **Functional programming** and DSL design in Kotlin  

## Future Plans
- Add AI opponent  
- Improve UI animations  
- iOS and Desktop support
